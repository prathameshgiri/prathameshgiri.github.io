👋 Hello! I'm Prathamesh Giri, a passionate web developer 💻

🌐 I love crafting beautiful and functional websites that provide seamless user experiences. My skills range from front-end development using modern frameworks like React.js, Vue.js, and Angular, to back-end development with Node.js, Express, and Django.

🔨 I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm always excited to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. I enjoy working on both small-scale projects and larger, complex applications.

🚀 Collaboration is at the heart of my work. I thrive in team environments, leveraging tools like Git and GitHub for version control and project management. I also actively contribute to open-source projects to give back to the community and improve my coding skills.

💡 Beyond coding, I have a keen eye for design and usability, ensuring that my projects not only function flawlessly but also look visually appealing. I believe in the power of clean code and strive for excellence in every line I write.

🌍 Let's connect! Feel free to reach out to me for collaboration, freelance opportunities, or just to say hi. You can find me on GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter. I'm always excited to discuss new ideas and work on exciting projects.

Happy coding! 😄
